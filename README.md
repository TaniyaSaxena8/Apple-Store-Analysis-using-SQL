# Apple-Store-Analysis-using-SQL
**OBJECTIVE**
---
The Apple Store is like a huge digital marketplace where you can find lots of mobile apps for various purposes. It's essential for our digital lives, offering us ways to work, chat with friends, and have fun on our devices. Think of it as a mirror that shows us how technology is changing, what people like, and all the new and creative mobile apps that people are making.

The goal of this analysis was to deep dive into the vast reservoir of data generated by the Apple Store, leveraging the power of Structured Query Language (SQL) to reveal invaluable insights.

**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**
---
**1. Number of unique apps**
```js
SELECT COUNT(Distinct id) 
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore

SELECT COUNT(Distinct id) 
FROM Apple.dbo.appleStore_description
```
Both the files show 7197 apps.

**2. Check for missing values**
```js
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_values
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
WHERE track_name IS NULL OR user_rating IS NULL OR prime_genre IS NULL OR size_bytes IS NULL OR rating_count_tot IS NULL OR sup_devices_num IS NULL 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_values
FROM Apple.dbo.appleStore_description
WHERE app_desc IS NULL
```
There are '0' missing values in both the files.

**3. Number of apps per genre**
```js
SELECT prime_genre, COUNT(*) AS Num_apps
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY Num_apps
```

**4. Rating overview of apps**
```js
SELECT MIN(user_rating) AS Min_rating,
       MAX(user_rating) AS Max_rating,
	   AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
```

**5. Content rating overview**
```js
SELECT MIN(cont_rating) AS Min_cont_rating,
       MAX(cont_rating) AS Max_cont_rating,
	   AVG(cont_rating) AS Avg_cont_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore

SELECT Distinct cont_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
```

**DATA ANALYSIS**
---
**1. Determine the effect of price on user rating**
```js
SELECT CASE 
            WHEN price > 0 THEN 'Paid' 
	        ELSE 'Free'
       END AS AppType,
	   AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
GROUP BY CASE 
            WHEN price > 0 THEN 'Paid' 
	        ELSE 'Free'
       END
```

**2. Average rating of the app according to number of languages supporting**
```js
SELECT CASE
            WHEN lang_num < 10 THEN '<10 Languages'
			WHEN lang_num BETWEEN 11 AND 30 THEN '11-30 Languages'
			ELSE '30 Languages'
	   END AS language_bucket,
	   AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
GROUP BY CASE
            WHEN lang_num < 10 THEN '<10 Languages'
			WHEN lang_num BETWEEN 11 AND 30 THEN '11-30 Languages'
			ELSE '30 Languages'
	   END
```

**3. Apps group by genre with high ratings**
```js
SELECT prime_genre,AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY Avg_rating DESC 
```

**4. Apps group by genre with low ratings**
```js
SELECT prime_genre,AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY Avg_rating ASC
```

SELECT prime_genre, track_name, user_rating
FROM ( SELECT prime_genre, track_name, user_rating,
	   RANK() OVER(PARTITION by prime_genre ORDER BY user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESC) AS rank
	   FROM Apple.dbo.AppleStore) AS a
WHERE a.rank=1
